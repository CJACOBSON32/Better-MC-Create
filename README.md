Create Quest is a fork of [Better MC](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-forge-bmc4) by [SHXRKIE](https://www.curseforge.com/members/shxrkie/projects). Some questlines were also borrowed from [All the Mods 9](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-9) by . All credit goes to the respective creators. They likely need no introduction as they are some of the most popular packs, but I highly recommend them if you haven't tried them.
